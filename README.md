# neuroscatter - Code for "Fully Non-Linear Neuromorphic Computing with Linear Wave Scattering" (C. Wanjura and F. Marquardt)

This repository contains the source code for the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16181 on nonlinear neuromorphic computing via linear wave scattering. 

See the two subdirectories for the code used in handwritten-digit recognition (a scaled-down version of MNIST) and for fashion-MNIST (with many more neurons and trainable parameters). This code can be run directly to reproduce the results shown in the figures (although a GPU is advisable, and you may have to wait several hours or even days if running for 1000 epochs) in some cases).
