We consider the following data set of 8x8 pixel images displaying hand-written digits:
Alpaydin and C. Kaynak, Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits, UCI Machine Learning Repository (1998), DOI:https://doi.org/10.24432/C50P49.

The training data is contained in the file optdigits.tes, the test data in the file optdigits.tra

- Code to train the neuromorphic systems: neuromorphic_training_digitRecognition.ipynb
- Code to train the ANNs for comparison: training_KerasANNs_digitRecognition.ipynb
  (the ANNs have the same or approximately the same number of parameters as the neuromorphic systems)
- Code for comparing neuromorphic and ANN results: comparison_digitRecognition.ipynb
